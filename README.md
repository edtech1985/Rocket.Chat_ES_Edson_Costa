# Rocket.Chat_ES_Edson_Costa
Welcome to my Rocket.Chat Enterprise Solutions Technical Assessment repository!

## ðŸš€ Overview
This repository contains the results of the technical assessment for the Rocket.Chat Enterprise Solutions Team. It includes the setup and deployment of a Rocket.Chat server instance, as well as the API queries and updates performed.

## ðŸš€ Rocket.Chat Server Setup
To complete the technical assessment, I followed the installation method recommended in the Rocket.Chat documentation, which involved using Docker & Docker Compose. Here are the steps I followed:

1. Installation Method:
   - I chose to install Rocket.Chat using Docker & Docker Compose. I followed the steps provided in the Rocket.Chat documentation: [Docker & Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.rocket.chat/deploy/prepare-for-your-deployment/rapid-deployment-methods/docker-and-docker-compose).

2. URL:
   - Initially, I used the URL `edtech1985:3000` to run the server locally since I was the only user accessing it. However, to allow external users to access it, I used Ngrok to generate a temporary URL. The installation and setup instructions for Ngrok can be found at [Ngrok Docs](https://ngrok.com/docs/).
   - Important: Please notify me when evaluating the assessment so that I can run the server and provide you with the updated Ngrok URL.

3. Access Credentials:
   - User: edtechRocketChat
   - Password: Provided via email

Please refer to the respective documentation links for detailed instructions on each step.

Please refer to the [installation documentation](https://docs.rocket.chat/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat) for detailed information on Rocket.Chat installation methods and setup instructions.
